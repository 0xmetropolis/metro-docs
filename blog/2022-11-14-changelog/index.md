New features and improvements.

<!-- truncate -->

## Added
- Shipped membership and finances lenses! These can be found on the podarchy page. For example, here's the one for [ENS DAO](https://pod.xyz/podarchy/0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7).
- Shipped pod descriptions! Pods can now add a description for their pod. This description is stored as NFT metadata, which means it can be consumed by other apps too. The descriptions appears on the pod's page and podarchy.


## Changed
- Restyled the way pod names are added to the NFT images. Previously, we had some color conflicts, but these are resolved now. Check it out the pods [OpenSea collection](https://opensea.io/collection/pods-v2).
- The podarchy spatial interface now uses a force directed layout. This gives the interface a more life.

## Fixed
- Various podarchy issues are fixed, such as correctly showing the threshold, showing member pods in the side bar and caching issues.
