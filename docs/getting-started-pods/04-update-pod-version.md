Keeping your pod up-to-date ensures that you have access to the latest features and performance improvements. A transaction to update the pod version can be created from the pod settings menu. 

## 1. Go to pod page

On the pod page, open the pod settings menu.

## 4. Gather consensus and execute

Once the threshold has been reached, the transaction to update the pod can be executed. This is an on-chain transaction, which means that the address that executes the transaction should have enough ETH to pay the gas fee.
