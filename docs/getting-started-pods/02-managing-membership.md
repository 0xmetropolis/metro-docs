##### How to manage memberships for your pod.
---


There are a few ways in which membership can be managed for a pod:

* Add/remove members
* Adding a new pod admin
* Transferring membership/pod admin key


## Selecting your pod and role
From any pod page, access the Manage form and select the action (e.g., "Manage members", "Transfer membership or admin key") you want to take.

It's possible that you may hold multiple [roles](/docs/pod-basics/pod-roles-and-memberhsip#pod-roles) for a given pod. For example, you may be an admin AND a member of a pod.

If you choose to act as an admin, your actions not require pod approval.

## Adding and removing members
You can choose to add or remove members from your pod. If you are a member of the pod or a member pod, this flow will result in a proposal submitted to the pod for approval. If you are an admin, you will have the rights to add or remove a member directly.

Members can be actual end users or other pods.

## Adding a pod admin
You can add an admin to your pod if one has not been set yet. This flow will result in a proposal being submitted to the pod for new pod admin approval. Admins cannot add admins - only transfer their admin keys.

Admins can be actual end users, other pods or smart contracts.

## Transferring membership / pod admin key
You can transfer your membership or pod admin key by navigating to other users or pods. These transactions do not require pod approval.
