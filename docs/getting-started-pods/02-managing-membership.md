##### How to manage memberships for your pod.

There are a few ways in which membership can be managed for a pod:

* Add/remove members
* Adding a new pod admin
* Transferring membership/pod admin key

## Adding and Removing Members
You can add or remove members by navigating to the "Manage Pod" page. If you are a member, this flow will result in a proposal submitted to the pod for approval. If you are an admin, you will have the rights to add or remove a member directly.

Members can be actual end users or other pods.
