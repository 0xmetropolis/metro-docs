##### The benefits of using pods.

## All Your Safes in One Interface

Proposals across all your multi-sigs are aggregated into one interface â€’ making it easy for signers to quickly approve transactions and closing the gap between idea and execution.

## Manage Signers with Zero Fuss

With admin capabilities and NFTs for managing signers, mass onboarding and off-boarding contributors is simple. By providing a legible permissions layer, pods ensure that the right amount of governable surface area is exposed. This directly addresses the problem of DAOs lacking accountability and visibility in their control structure.

## Give your Safe an Identity

No need to waste time and energy identifying multi-sig addresses. Every pod has a unique NFT, ENS name, and matching URL. These elements are combined to create a public identity around working groups. It creates more transparency and gives DAO contributors and partners better visibility into the network of people in the ecosystem.

## Organizational Adaptability

Pods are designed to be modular and flexible. They provide structural support for your organization as it evolves and matures. This enables DAOs to create custom organizational designs that meet their unique requirements.

## Workflow Optimization

Metropolis is actively expanding its list of partnerships and integrations across the web3 landscape. This means that working groups running on pods are able to coordinate through a growing number of web3 native tools.
