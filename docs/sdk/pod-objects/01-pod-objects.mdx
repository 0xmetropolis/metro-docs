##### Fetch pod object data, manage memberships and admin roles through the Orca SDK.

---

## Importing Types

Pod and Proposal are the two types available in our SDK. Types can be imported with the following:

```js
import { Pod, Proposal } from '@orcaprotocol/orca-sdk';
```

## Pod
### Fetching pods
Once you init the SDK, you can call `getPod()`, `getUserPods()`, or `getAdminPods()` anywhere to fetch Pod objects.

Using these functions can help you present and organize your application accordingly to pod and pod member structures of connected users.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="query"
  values={[
    { label: 'Query', value: 'query', },
    { label: 'Response', value: 'response', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="query">

```js
import { getPod, getUserPods, getAdminPods } from '@orcaprotocol/orca-sdk';

// ENS names also work for the below.
const podFromEnsName = await getPod('mypod.pod.xyz');
const podFromAddress = await getPod('0x123...456');
const podFromId = await getPod(1);
// Returns null
const notAPod = await getPod('not a pod');

// Fetches all Pods that a user is a member of
const userPods = await getUserPods(userAddress);

// Fetches all Pods that a user is an admin of
const adminPods = await getAdminPods(adminAddress);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response">

```js
const {
  id, // Pod ID
  safe, // Gnosis safe address, aka the Pod address
  ensName, // E.g., orcanauts.pod.xyz
  admin, // Address of pod admin
  imageUrl, // Source of NFT image
  imageNoTextUrl, // Source of NFT image without text (used for avatars)
} = await getPod();
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Fetching members, EOAs, subpods and super pods

Members, EOAs, subpods and super pods can be fetched with the following functions:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="query"
  values={[
    { label: 'Query', value: 'query', },
    { label: 'Response', value: 'response', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="query">

```js
const pod = await getPod(podAddress);
// Fetches list of all members from the pod, as an array of Ethereum addresses.
// This includes any pods that may be members of the original pods.
const members = await pod.getMembers();

// Fetches any member EOAs (externally owned accounts). That is, any member that is not a smart contract or pod.
const memberEOAs = await pod.getMemberEOAs();

// Fetches Pod objects for any sub pods of a given pod
const memberPods = await pod.getMemberPods();

// For a given pod, fetches all sub pods a given user is a part of
const subPodsOfMember = await pod.getSubPodsByMember(userAddress);

// Fetch the super pod of a given pod, if relevant. 
const superPods = await pod.getSuperPods();
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="response">

```js
const hello = await getpod(pod);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
