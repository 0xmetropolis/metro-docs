![Token Republic](./img/token-republic.png)

The token republic model gives token holders the ultimate authority over pods by letting them vote to modify pod configurations.

Token voters can make these decisions through on-chain governance like the Governor contract or through off-chain voting through Snapshot + Gnosis multisigs.

By delegating a podâ€™s admin key to a token holder empowered voting mechanism, DAOs can set voting and quorum criteria in order to add, remove, or modify pod configurations.

### Use Cases

- Providing oversight to working groups
- Electing council members
- Electing workstream leads

### **Pros**

- Token holders are empowered with ultimate decision-making authority.
- Working groups derive their legitimacy from token holders, creating a clear line of accountability and consent.
- Pod members are incentivized to publicly share their work for greater visibility and transparency

### **Cons**

- Token holders must stay informed about workstream activity in order to intelligently manage their membership.
- Token holder elections can turn into popularity contests with high visibility individuals being elected rather than those with the deepest knowledge.
- Voter apathy and whales can lead to individuals and small groups of voters having undue influence over pod membership and management.

### **Examples**

    ENS has four separate working groups, all of which are headed by stewards that are elected by token holders.
