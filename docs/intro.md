##### Welcome to Orca Protocol's docs - documentation for the people-first protocol.

## What Is Orca Protocol?

Orca Protocol is an extensible and modular DAO implementation, built around small working groups called pods. Each pod has a Gnosis Safe multi-sig wallet, which is controlled by the pod members through a proposal-approval mechanism.
Pods use a lightweight approval mechanism to vote on and execute transactions. The UI is focused on pod member management and the display of pod composability.
